# Work With Us

### We are looking for someone who will thrive on the challenge of sharing power with young people.

Does this hold true for you...?

* You want to be part of a setting where children are at the helm of their own education.
* You are comfortable inspiring young people rather than directing them.
* You are curious about the world and constantly learning.
* You ask questions instead of assuming the answers.
* You are comfortable not knowing all the answers… even in front of a group of kids!&#x20;
* You play. You have fun playing.&#x20;
* You can use humour to bond with kids and make them feel at ease.
* You spend time outdoors and enjoy being in nature.
* You can be empathetic in the face of adversity.
* You are willing to work towards an unconditional approach (no punishment or reward, including praise).
* You find it easy to be flexible and change plans when something unexpected happens.&#x20;
* You see yourself as a problem-solver.&#x20;

### We will greatly value your experience in:

* Woodwork and maker fablabs
* Bushcraft skills
* Permaculture
* Active listening and non violent communication
* Playing musical instruments of any sort (including instruments from junk)
* Promoting social justice
* Using maths manipulatives
* Making and recording observations
* Project based learning
* Progressive, inquiry-based education

Relevant qualifications, though not necessarily as a teacher –as well as a commitment to professional development– are essential. If you are not a native Spanish speaker, Spanish is not a requirement but would be an advantage.

Since we encourage age-mixed groups, there will be opportunities to work with children of all ages (3-12).&#x20;

## What we can offer:

* The opportunity to enjoy working in a small but highly motivated team, with children who are eager to learn, in a school community where parents are very supportive, in the beautiful city of La Laguna, Tenerife (Canary Islands).
* We provide in-house training for continuous professional development.
* Long-term contract.
* Salary according to your experience and qualifications, and to the Spanish Convenio de Educación de Enseñanza Privada

## How to apply

Please send us your CV and cover letter.

**Closing date for applications is 19th of May 2024.**
