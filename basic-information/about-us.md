# About Kaleide

Kaleide International School is **a home-like setting** where children find continuity between their family, their school and the wider society; a growth-mindset-friendly community where children feel **safe from judgement**, respected in their own rhythms, and supported in their full potential; a learning environment which inspires **wonder, curiosity, research, experimentation, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.**

We foster children's **self-motivation and autonomy**, together with **critical and divergent thinking**, **emotional awareness** and competence, while nurturing their inner sense of **belonging and connectedness to nature.**\

In addition to being a foreign school authorized by the Department of Education of the Government of the Canary Islands, Kaleide has been engaged in the accreditation process with NEASC (New England Association of Schools and Colleges) since April 2020. We currently hold “Candidate” status, a recognition of our efforts to create a high-quality learning environment.

The founders of Kaleide are Diego and Diana, who have spent the last twelve years researching and exploring alternatives to mainstream education in search of approaches which take into account the actual needs of children. Throughout these years, they have shared their insights and discoveries through social media, a [blog](https://www.estonoesunaescuela.org) and a documentary film. Diego and Diana see Kaleide as an opportunity to bring their knowledge and experience into a school which combines their love of nature and their passion for democratic education.
