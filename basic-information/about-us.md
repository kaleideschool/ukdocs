# About us

Kaleide International School will be **a home-like setting** where children will find continuity between their family, their school and the wider society; a growth-mindset-friendly community where children feel **safe from judgement**, respected in their own rhythms, and supported in their full potential; a learning environment which inspires **wonder, curiosity, research, experimentation, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.**

We foster children's **self-motivation and autonomy**, together with **critical and divergent thinking**, **emotional awareness** and competence, while nurturing their inner sense of **belonging and connectedness to nature.**

In April 2020 Kaleide International School has been admitted by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges \(NEASC\) to its prestigious accreditation process. The NEASC is recognised as an approved _accreditation_ agency by the National Association of Independent Schools and the United States Department of Education.

The founders of Kaleide are Diego and Diana, who have spent the last eight years researching and exploring alternatives to mainstream education in search of approaches which take into account the actual needs of children. Throughout these years, they have shared their insights and discoveries through social media, a [blog](www.estonoesunaescuela.org) and a documentary film which will premiere in 2021. Diego and Diana see Kaleide as an opportunity to cristallize these life-changing experiences into a school which combines their love of nature and their passion for democratic education.
