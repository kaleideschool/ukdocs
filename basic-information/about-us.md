# About Kaleide

Kaleide International School is a family-run, progressive school in Tenerife. Our dream is to create a space where children are truly heard, where education respects their individual rhythms, and where learning is joyful, meaningful, and deeply human.

We foster children's **self-motivation and autonomy**, together with **critical and divergent thinking**, **emotional awareness** and competence, while nurturing their inner sense of **belonging and connectedness to nature.**\

In addition to being a foreign school authorized by the Department of Education of the Government of the Canary Islands, Kaleide has been engaged in the accreditation process with NEASC (New England Association of Schools and Colleges) since April 2020. We currently hold “Candidate” status, a recognition of our efforts to create a high-quality learning environment.

The founders of Kaleide are Diego and Diana, who have spent the last twelve years researching and exploring alternatives to mainstream education in search of approaches which take into account the actual needs of children. Throughout these years, they have shared their insights and discoveries through social media, a [blog](https://www.estonoesunaescuela.org) and a documentary film. Diego and Diana see Kaleide as an opportunity to bring their knowledge and experience into a school which combines their love of nature and their passion for democratic education.
