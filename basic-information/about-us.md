# About us

Kaleide International School will be **a home-like setting** where children will find continuity between their family, their school and the wider society; a growth-mindset-friendly community where children feel **safe from judgement**, respected in their own rhythms, and supported in their full potential; a learning environment which inspires **wonder, curiosity, research, experimentation, problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration.**

We foster children's **self-motivation and autonomy**, together with **critical and divergent thinking**, **emotional awareness** and competence, while nurturing their inner sense of **belonging and connectedness to nature.**
