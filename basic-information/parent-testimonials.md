# Parent Testimonials



> _We have been in Kaleide for two years and we are very happy. Our older daughter had a long period of adaptation to a new country and a new language and in Kaleide she found understanding, patience and in her time she went through a crisis and opened up to a new language and friendships. We received a lot of support from the entire team in the first year for which we are very grateful. Now we have two children in Kaleide and yes - it is an education that is far from what we know, but we as parents were looking for exactly this for our children._&#x20;

> _This is our fourth year at Kaleide, and we've had a very positive experience. We're very grateful to be part of this school and the wonderful families who are part of it. The teaching team is highly trained and motivated. They guide the children with great awareness and heart. Our daughter is very happy there because she's taken into account and respected. For her, going to school every day is like living an adventure. The strengths we appreciate are: self-directed learning, fostering creativity, contact with nature, social-emotional development, and its democratic philosophy—they can decide on its rules, operations, and more. Without a doubt, the best education for success in such a changing and challenging world._

> _Our son has been attending Kaleide since spring 2024. We accompanied him for many weeks in the beginning and were able to gain a thorough impression of the facility, the teachers, and the daily routines over an extended period of time. The daily program and every interaction with the children are based on intention, structure, and mindfulness, while the individual level of development of each child is respected and unnecessary constraints are avoided. This is an extremely demanding task, and we are grateful to have found a school – and people – who are willing to take on this task._
>
> _Since starting at Kaleide, our son has shown clear development in self-confidence, trust in his abilities, and the capacity to follow and follow through on his interests, eagerly acquiring the skills necessary to do so. One example is him becoming fluent in both English and Spanish effortlessly._
>
> _We also deeply appreciate that Kaleide considers the well-being of the whole family. The drop-off times and general organization greatly reduce everyday stress for parents, allowing for a relaxed start and end to the schoolday. Engagement and participation are warmly welcomed but never demanded from parents, which creates an atmosphere of ease and balance for families._
>
> _Kaleide embodies a new approach to schooling, and for those who can trust their child and this path, it becomes a place that truly feels like home._

> (Jasmin Wegener)

> _I've been part of the project since its earliest days. I'm the father of two children who spent three years at Kaleide. My children's experience was positive, and most importantly, they entered and left school with enthusiasm and happiness. Any differences with the school arose, they were discussed and resolved, reaching a common ground._
>
> _The school is trying, and succeeding, each year more, to revolutionize education, based on much personal and family sacrifice from its founders._
>
> _Good luck and continue with this wonderful project, full of color, even in its name._

> (César M CG)

> _This is our fourth year at Kaleide, and for my son, it's been a wonderful experience. The fact that he's eager to return to school and that when you take him, he says, "Oh, another day at my wonderful school," says it all! I'd also like to say that it's a spectacular place where children are the center and their emotional education is the foundation of everything. This undoubtedly translates into self-confident, super-happy children surrounded by professionals who listen to them above all else._
>
> _And what can I say about the people who made this happen? People with a beautiful life mission who want to do their part to make education different, and they're achieving it._

> (Gemma Fernández Rodríguez)

> _We are so grateful that our daughter can attend Kaleide. A school where she feels heard, respected, and where her opinions are taken into account. And, above all, where she is happy and enthusiastic every day. I think we couldn't ask for more. I encourage anyone who believes a school should be more than just a place where content is taught to visit Kaleide. They will discover that an education based on self-knowledge, being able to direct your own learning based on your interests, and developing healthy self-esteem is not only possible but a reality. Thank you, Kaleide!_

> _We are deeply grateful and truly inspired to be part of such a caring and forward-thinking community. It fills us with joy to see the school grow stronger and more vibrant with each passing year._
>
> _Our daughter, now nine years old, has blossomed into a confident, curious, and well-rounded young person who enjoys every moment of her school life. Because Kaleide is still a small and close-knit school, the facilitators have the opportunity to truly know each child, guiding them with care and helping them discover the best version of themselves. Their dedication and creativity make learning both fun and meaningful, adapting to the unique needs of every student._

> _We feel incredibly fortunate to have found a place where our daughter is not only learning but thriving — and most importantly, she is genuinely happy at school.❤️_

> _My son joined Kaleide in an unusual way, in the form of a short-term study of only two months. He loved it from the first days, and it was nice to see the change in him during his time there. In this school, the children are not anxious, not exhausted, but motivated, open and cheerful. They are healthy physically and mentally. Thank you, Laura, Reuben, Diana and everyone at Kaleide - we want to come again next year!_

> _We had a wonderful first month at Kaleide and look forward to many more to come. I personally truly enjoyed the bonding period as I could witness first hand how the team works, what our kids do throughout the day and how they feel like at Kaleide._
>
> _It's amazing how well organised the school is, especially for the fact that it's a new school and still in development. I also like the way Kaleide encourages families and the school team to become a big family._

> _It's a joy to have the opportunity to take my daughter to this school. She loves it, and of course, we do too. A respectful place where she learns to be independent, at her own pace and according to her needs._

> (Jesús Torres)

> _It was a pleasure for us to be part of the Kaleide community. And thank you so much for these wonderful evaluations -- they're thoughtful, thorough, ring true to us, and taught us new things about our children. We've sent our kids to several schools over the past few years, and none has given us anything like this. So thank you so much._
