# Languages at Kaleide

{% hint style="info" %}
At Kaleide, languages are learnt in a practical hands-on way with native facilitators, in the context of day-to-day activities and conversations. Our facilitators always use their mother tongues to speak with the children.
{% endhint %}

At Kaleide activities are both in English and in Spanish. Facilitators use their mother tongue or English to speak with the children.

As Kaleide grows we would like to bring in other languages and nationalities.&#x20;
