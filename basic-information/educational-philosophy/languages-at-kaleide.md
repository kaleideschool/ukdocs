# Languages at Kaleide

{% hint style="info" %}
At Kaleide, languages are learnt in a practical hands-on way with native facilitators, in the context of day-to-day activities and conversations. Our facilitators always use their mother tongues to speak with the children.
{% endhint %}

Kaleide's working language is English, but Spanish is present in many activities and workshops. During our first year we shall have four facilitators on our pedagogical team:

* two British-trained native English facilitators \(Theresa and Dhama\);
* two Spanish facilitators \(MÃ³nica y Paloma\).

As Kaleide grows we would like to bring in other languages and nationalities, although English will continue to be our working language.
