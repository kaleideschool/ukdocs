# Timetable

The school is open from **9.00 to 2.00, Monday to Friday**. Children can stay at the school for lunch, but need to bring their lunch from home or arrange with the school to have a catering meal which is paid for separately.&#x20;

For parents who need to drop their children off earlier, or pick them up later, **we offer before school care as of 8.15, and after care from 2.00 to 4.00.**&#x20;

#### Relaxed entry

Having a "relaxed entry" means we allow children to arrive at the school during an extended period of time, thus reducing stress and hurry for families.

Our doors open for a first entry period from 8:45 to 9:25, so that parents can come into the school and spend some minutes with their children if they wish. We shall open our doors again between 9.50 and 10.00.
