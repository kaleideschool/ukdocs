# Opening Hours

The school is open from **9am to 2pm, Monday to Friday**. Lunch is included in the fees.

For parents who need to drop their children off earlier, or pick them up later, **we offer before school care as of 8.00, and after care from 2pm to 4pm. This is included in the fees.**

#### Relaxed entry

In Preschool, we open doors between 8:45 and 9:40 so that families can make a relaxed entrance to the school.
