Before or at the time their children start at Kaleide, all families need to attend a workshop where they are informed about:

* how parents are expected to behave whilst in the school;
* health and safety issues;
* school policies \(conflict resolution, anti-bullying, child safety, communication, etc.\);
* the school's parents association;
* the school's educational philosophy;

This workshop is €95 per family, and discounts apply.

{% tab title="Deposit" %}
This is a sole payment which varies according to the number of children enroled. It is refundable at the end of every year, or when your child leaves Kaleide.

We offer two payment options:

* **Advance payment for a whole school year:**  5% discount on tuition fees. 
* **10 monthly payments:** no discounts apply. The first payment should be made before September, the remaining will be charged on the first day of each month.  Although we suggest 10 monthly payments, we are open to other arrangements with each family as long as long as there are no outstanding payments.

In addition to the advance payment discount, we offer additional and accumulative discounts in the following cases:

* **Siblings discount:** each additional sibling has a 25%.
* **Single parent discount:** this is similar to you will be required to provide proof of financial income.
