We offer two payment options:

* **Advance payment for a whole school year:**  5% discount on tuition fees.&#x20;
* **10 monthly payments:** no discounts apply. The first payment should be made before September, the remaining will be charged on the first day of each month.  Although we suggest 10 monthly payments, we are open to other arrangements with each family as long as long as there are no outstanding payments.

In addition to the advance payment discount, we offer a **siblings discount for** families who have two or more siblings enrolled concurrently at the school.
