# Fees

Our fees are flexible and we offer discounts for advance payment, single parents, and siblings. During our first year, we are also offering reduced start-up fees. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Check out our reduced fees for the 2020-21 school year.
{% endhint %}

In the Early Years, our fees vary between  €356 and €395 depending on discounts applicable. In Primary they vary between €356 and €495. These fees do not include our 25% discount for siblings.

The table below describes the different payments required throughout the school year:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Enrolment" %}
The enrolment fee for new students is a sole payment of €350. This is not refundable. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Materials" %}
This is a yearly payment which may vary slightly from one year to the next. For the 2020-21 school year, the cost of materials is €150 per child.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Workshop for families" %}
Before or at the time their children start at Kaleide, all families need to attend a workshop where they are informed about:

* how parents are expected to behave whilst in the school;
* health and safety issues;
* school policies \(conflict resolution, anti-bullying, child safety, communication, etc.\);
* the school's parents association;
* the school's educational philosophy;

This workshop is €95 per family, and discounts apply.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deposit" %}
This is a sole payment which varies according to the number of children enroled. It is refundable at the end of every year, or when your child leaves Kaleide.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tuition" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
Tuition fees decrease with each year a child spends at Kaleide.
{% endhint %}

We offer two payment options:

* **Advance payment for a whole school year:**  5% discount on tuition fees. 
* **10 monthly payments:** no discounts apply. The first payment should be made before September, the remaining will be charged on the first day of each month.  Although we suggest 10 monthly payments, we are open to other arrangements with each family as long as long as there are no outstanding payments.

In addition to the advance payment discount, we offer additional and accumulative discounts in the following cases:

* **Siblings discount:** each additional sibling has a 25%.
* **Single parent discount:** this is similar to you will be required to provide proof of financial income.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In the table below, "Año I", "Año II", etc. refers to the number of years a child has been at the Kaleide, not the year group they belong to according to their age.
{% endhint %}

For parents who need to drop their children off earlier, or pick them up later, **we offer before school care as of 8.30, and after care from 3.00 to 3.30.** 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Before care" %}
From 8.30 to 9.00, Monday to Friday. This can be paid per month or per day.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="After care" %}
From 3.00 to 3.30. This can be paid for per month or per day.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lunch" %}
Children can stay at the school for lunch, from 2.00 to 3.00 \(during our first year this is included in the school fees, but children need to bring their lunch from home or arrange with the school to have a catering meal which is paid separately\). 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Prices for the catering meal are approximate.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

  * they pay tuition fees in one single payment.
