### Will there be a bus route? Is it easy to park close to the school? Is the school easy to access?

We are happy to arrange a minibus route if there is a minimum number of families who are interested. Promoting sustainable transport practices is one of our priorities. We would like to help families reduce their dependency on private transport and promote the use of public transport, together with cycling and walking to school. You won't find a car park at the school. Kaleide is close to several bus stops and there is a public car park in our vicinity. The tram stop is 22 minutes away.

The following video is an example of the kind of project we would love to be involved with in the near future in relation to transport:
