# Management Structure

Kaleide International School is privately owned by a limited company, and the proprietor is the School Director. The following is an outline of our proposed management structure:

* School Director
* School Coordinator
* Pedagogical Team
* Advisory Committee

Proprietor: Diana de Horna Cicka

Diana de Horna has been involved in education since 2012, through the independent project _Esto no es una escuela_, which developed into a blog on active learning pedagogies, a small publishing house and a documentary film which will premiere in 2020 after being crowdfunded by nearly 1,000 supporters. She has also translated and published the first Spanish edition of Professor Peter Gray's acclaimed book Free to Learn, and has written pieces on education for The Huffington Post.

Together with Diego Gutiérrez Marañón, between 2014 and 2018, Diana visited over 30 innovative schools in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States, where she was able to interview dozens of students, parents, educators and experts in education. It is these schools and people that have become the inspiration for Kaleide International School.

Diana can draw upon 22 years of professional experience, working first as a press officer and director with the human rights organisation Survival International, and later as an air traffic controller in Tenerife, where she currently lives. She holds a bachelor's degree in Psychology and a postgraduate degree in Literary Translation, and attended the British Council School in Madrid from 1978 to 1991.

## Roles and Responsibilities <a id="h.l5dizolft3gy"></a>

### School Director <a id="h.caeauf2bfm2p"></a>

The Director is in a non-teaching role and is responsible for managing administrative tasks \(except those outsourced through an external company, such as bookkeeping, tax compliance and payroll\) and supervising the functioning of the school. Specifically, her duty is to:

* set the ethos, principles, and approach for our school, and communicate them to students, staff, parents and the community;
* create and maintain a healthy and safe space for learning;
* set the policies and strategies for developing the school's educational approach;
* monitor and evaluate the progress the school is making towards achieving its aims and objectives;
* select, hire, train and support staff members, and delegate tasks;
* communicate with students, parents and staff;
* handle student admissions;
* keep to rules on equal opportunities;
* handle the school budget and control school finances;
* maintain secure funding of the school;
* make both daily and long-term decisions related to the functioning of the school.

In her role, the Director will be directly supported by the School Coordinator and the Advisory Committee.

### School Coordinator <a id="h.8o1u17k2ve7j"></a>

The School Coordinator is in a teaching role which involves direct communication with the School Director and with students and their families. Her role is:

* to develop a creative learning community across the school;
* to have knowledge, understanding and enthusiasm for creative and self-directed learning as a key to raising engagement and motivation;
* to involve parents and other members of the community extensively throughout the programme;
* to ensure that children play a meaningful and active role in learning that can truly reflect their interests, needs and enquiries;
* to coordinate, in partnership with the Director, meetings and activities with expert visitors, school staff and other partners;
* to ensure all programme activity is carried out with due regard to health and safety and the safeguarding of children and young people;
* to ensure that all monitoring and evaluation requirements are fulfilled and that the pedagogical team commits to developing reflective practice throughout the curriculum;
* to communicate on a weekly basis with the Director;
* to act as liaison between parents, students and facilitators.

### Pedagogical team <a id="h.feoum450rrfx"></a>

The Pedagogical Team will initially be composed of four facilitators \(as described in the Staffing Plans section of this Application\). Their roles are extensively described in pages XX to XX of this Application.

### Advisory Committee <a id="h.29ebfq1rcyu8"></a>

The School Advisory Committee serves in an advisory and voluntary capacity to support the school ethos, programmes, and activities. Members bring unique knowledge and skills, and provide links between the school and the wider community.

The Advisory Committee does not have formal authority to govern the organisation, that is, the Advisory Committee cannot issue directives which must be followed. Rather, the Advisory Committee serves to make recommendations and/or provide key information and materials to the Director and the Pedagogical Team.

At present, the school's Advisory Committee members are:

#### Diego Gutiérrez Marañón <a id="h.aofaxh477osr"></a>

Diego trained as an aerospace engineer and has been working as an air traffic controller for the past eighteen years. He speaks Spanish and English. His passions involve spending time in nature, playing and listening to music, technology, architecture and design, creative writing, cycling, travel and \(since his daughter's birth in 2012\) democratic education.

Together with Diana de Horna, he developed the _Esto no es una escuela_ blog on education and is co-director of the documentary film _Corriendo por las olas_ \(“Skimming the Waves”\) which will premiere in 2020.

Diego advises the school on ICT, strategic planning, business administration and finance.

#### Derry Hannam <a id="h.qqllf32ki9xt"></a>

Derry was a state secondary school teacher in the UK for twenty years. He then became a school inspector. He has been an adviser/trainer/rapporteur for the Council of Europe Education for Democratic Citizenship project and a researcher/adviser to the development of citizenship education in the English national curriculum.

At the request of the English ministry of education Derry authored the “Hannam Report” based on research that demonstrates associations between democratic, participative, student centred methods in schools and higher academic results, less anti-social behaviour, and better school attendance, especially for students from economically and socially deprived backgrounds. He has contributed to many conferences on the theme of Democratic Education and Education for Democracy including the recent Council of Europe World Forum on Democracy and Education in Strasbourg.

#### Katia Hueso Kortekaas <a id="h.w7undw78z5r"></a>

Katia holds a Master of Science in Biology from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, and a PhD in Society and Culture from the University of Barcelona. She is Adjunct Professor at ICAI University \(Universidad Pontífica de Comillas\).

Katia is also an internationally active consultant in environmental sustainability, working in Europe, America and Africa. In 2011 she founded "El Saltamontes", the first modern nature preschool in Spain, and shortly later she developed a project called "Naturaleza Inclusiva", aimed at promoting nature-based activities for families with SEND children.

She currently serves as Chairperson for the Asociación Nacional de Educación en la Naturaleza \(EdNa\). Katia is also a speaker, teacher-trainer and author of several books on the subject of nature-based education, such as _Somos naturaleza_ \(2017\) and _Jugar al aire libre_ \(2019\). She is passionate about nature and landscapes, and how we humans stand in them.
