## Activities and Philosophy

Our facilitators **respect children's individual rhythms and motivations** and develop activities that promote **social and emotional learning**, as well as **psychomotor development**, **autonomy, creativity, free play** and **collaboration**. These are some of the activities we offer: 

* wildlife observation
* storytelling
* land art
* collaborative games
* open air painting
* crafts using elements from nature and loose parts 

## Meeting Point

We will be meeting you at the school, located on 11 Camino Fuente Cañizares in La Laguna \(see map below\). We will also be doing activities such as cycling in Mesa Mota \(a flat-topped mountain with a laurel forest\).

This does not include breakfast, snacks or lunch, which need to be brought from home.

## What the children need to bring

It's important for your child to bring:

* a nutritious and delicious lunch
* extra snacks
* a refillable water bottle \(no disposable plastic please\)
* closed-toe shoes \(to prevent soil and pebbles from getting inside\).
* comfortable clothes that can get dirty
* a cap
* extra underwear and trousers/shorts for the younger children \(3-5\)
* sunscreen already applied for the day \(send extra if your child has sensitive skin\)
* face mask \(only for children six years of age or older; although we shan't be using them within our group we will use them during drop-off and pick-up, as well as when we are unable to maintain social distancing with other individuals not in our group\)



## Health and Safety measures

Each facilitator will bring hand sanitizer and a bottle with soapy water. We will also have a first-aid kit with us, as well as bags for waste disposal. 

We have civil liability and accidents insurance, and our facilitators have First Aid training.

I relation to COVID-19 prevention measures, all families taking part in the summer camp must read and accept our [COVID-19 protocol](covid-19-prevention-protocol.md) before joining us.
