Our facilitators respect children's individual rhythms and motivations and develop activities that promote social and emotional learning, as well as psychomotor development, autonomy, creativity, free play and collaboration. These are some of the activities we offer: 

* wildlife observation
* storytelling
* land art
* collaborative games
* open air painting
* crafts using elements from nature and loose parts 

Our meeting point is located at the entrance of the Área Recreativa Mesa Mota \(a flat-topped mountain with a laurel forest\) where we will spend the morning enjoying the views, the fresh air and all that nature has to offer. We may also walk to the nearby Parque de la Vega, depending on what the group prefers to do.

Mesa  Mota is a short drive from the town centre. To get there you will need to take Calle Pozo Cabildo, and turn at Camino Mesa Mota. We will meet you under the sign indicating the entrance to the Área Recreativa.

**The price per day is €12 \(€60 per week\).** This does not include breakfast, snacks or lunch, which need to be brought from home. You are requested to pay for the total number days your child is coming, and this should be done in the first week of attendance. Unfortunately we are unable to reimburse you if your child does not come on the scheduled days.

**You may bring your child later than 8.30am and pick them up earlier than 3pm as long as you give us advance notice.** In that case, fees remain the same.

Each facilitator will bring hand sanitizer, a bottle with soapy water and alcohol-based disinfectant wipes. We will also have a first-aid kit with us, as well as bags for waste disposal. 

It's important for your child to bring:

* a nutritious and delicious lunch
* extra snacks
* a refillable water bottle \(no disposable plastic please\)
* closed-toe shoes \(to prevent soil and pebbles from getting inside\).
* comfortable clothes that can get dirty
* sunscreen already applied for the day \(send extra if your child has sensitive skin\)
* face mask \(only for children six years of age or older; although we shan't be using them within our group we will use them during drop-off and pick-up, as well as when we are unable to maintain social distancing with other individuals not in our group\)
* a reflective security vest

We have civil liability and accidents insurance, and our facilitators have First Aid training.

I relation to COVID-19 prevention measures, all families taking part in the summer camp must read and accept our [COVID-19 protocol](covid-19-prevention-protocol.md) before joining us.
