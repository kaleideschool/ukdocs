# COVID-19 Prevention Protocol

It is Kaleide Educación Activa’s commitment to care for children’s physical health and social-emotional needs. This protocol has been developed towards that aim, and taking into account the recommendations provided by agencies such as Unicef or the WHO, as well as the Protocolo de prevención y organización para el desarrollo de la actividad educativa presencial en los centros educativos no universitarios de Canarias, curso 2020-2021 issued by the Consejería de Educación del Gobierno de Canarias the most recent measures approved by the Gobierno de Canarias \(August 2020\).

**The purpose of this protocol is to establish collective,  individual and organizational preventive measures to protect our children and employees, and prevent the risk of contagion by COVID-19 in the summer camps that will take place from September 7th, 2020.**

The instructions and recommendations established in this protocol will be adapted to regulations issued by the health authorities in light of the evolution of the pandemic. They will also comply with the recommendations on prevention and hygiene that may be issued by the Ministry of Education of the Government of the Canary Islands. Any change will be communicated to the educational community through our usual communication channels with families and reflected on our website kaleide.org .     
  


## Preliminary Considerations

### Virus transmission

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter\) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  

People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.

The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.  


| Material | Persistence |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stainless Steel | 48 hours-7 days |
| Copper | 4 hours |
| Other metals | 2-8 hours |
| Cardboard | 24 hours |
| Money \(notes\) | 4 days |
| Glass | 4-5 days |
| Plastic | 72 hours-7 days |
| Latex | 8 hours |
| PVC | 5 days |
| Silicone | 5 days |
| Ceramics | 5 days |
| Teflon | 5 days |
| Surgical mask | 7 days |

### Symptoms of COVID-19

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.

Most people \(about 80%\) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated with difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.  


### The risk of contagion in children

Evidence to date suggests that children and young adults are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases can still happen in these age groups.

Children and adults should follow the same guidance on self-quarantine and self-isolation if there is a risk they have been exposed or are showing symptoms. It is particularly important that children avoid contact with older people and others who are at risk of more severe disease.  


### Preventive measures

Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.

When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating. 

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

* Wash hands thoroughly and frequently, preferably with soap and water, for 40 seconds; and, if not possible, with alcohol-based disinfectant for 20 seconds. Bear in mind that, when hands are visibly dirty, the alcohol-based disinfectant is not enough and you must use soap and water. 
* Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
* Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.
* Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
* Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
* Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

At our summer camps we will follow hand washing routines such as the main preventive measure. It is not necessary to use disinfectant; ordinary soap, be it solid or liquid, is enough. The important thing is to wash for at least 40-60 seconds. 

Learning these simple routines will also be very useful to prevent transmission of future winter viruses such as influenza, bronchiolitis or stomach flu.  Hand washing with soap and water is effective because the chemical composition of the soap opens the outer envelope of the coronavirus and causes it to degrade. The sanitizing gel should only be used in addition to washing, as it can affect the body's microbiomes, which, in the long run, eliminates benficial bacteria present on the skin. Alcohol-based disinfectant kills coronavirus, but not all types of bacteria and viruses; it is relatively ineffective against norovirus and rotavirus.  


### Disinfectant products

An important precaution to reduce the risk of infection is to clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched. If a surface is dirty, the first thing to do is to clean it with soap or detergent and water. Then, according to Unicef ​​recommendations, a disinfectant product containing alcohol \(about 70%\) or chlorine should be used. It is not advisable to use vinegar or other natural products. 

At our summer camps we will use the Sonnet surface disinfectant, which contains 70% ethanol \(vegetable alcohol\) for cleaning frequently used objects.  
  


### Stable coexistence group 

Given that our group is very small and that it is age-mixed, we have established a single stable coexistence group that encompasses all the children and their teachers.  The components of a stable coexistence group can socialize and play with each other without social distancing. In these groups masks will not be necessary and the facilitators may use masks at their own discretion.

#### For children

All children will be part of a single age-mixed “stable coexistence group”. Our children to adult ratio will be a maximum of 8 to 1;

● Hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette will be monitored; 

● Children will wear a mask in case of symptoms and need for isolation; 

● Workshops and activities designed to promote social distancing will be prioritized; 

● All activities will take place outdoors; 

● Materials provided will be for personal use; 

● If a family member shows Covid-19 symptoms, all family members will be isolated and must seek a health evaluation; 

● COVID-19 information will be provided to families and facilitators in order to promote co-responsibility;

● If a child does not attend the summer camp, the family will be contacted to find out the reason  

● Families will be able to take part in our activities at facilitators’ discretion, provided they comply with prevention and hygiene measures.  Under no circumstances will they be able to do this if they show any symptoms compatible with COVID-19.   


#### For facilitators

* Facilitators must wear masks and maintain social distancing with anyone outside the stable coexistence group; 
* Hand washing and respiratory etiquette will be essential; 
* Facilitators will wear specific clothes that are washed every day; 
* If you have symptoms associated with Covid-19, you must not go to work and should contact your doctor, who will give you appropriate indications; 
* Priority will be given to individual and active transportation \(walking, cycling\); 
* Facilitators will be responsible for monitoring hygiene measures by the children throughout the duration of summer camp activities, and also by their caregivers at drop-off and pick-up time. 
* Facilitators should inform Kaleide Educación Activa as soon as possible if they are unable to work, even if they are not on sick leave.   

#### Before going to work

If you have symptoms associated with COVID-19 \(cough, temperature, breathing difficulty, etc.\) you must not go to work and should contact the COVID-19 helpline and follow their instructions. You must not go to work until it is ascertained that you are under no risk.

If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. 

Even if you have no symptoms, if you have been in close contact with a person infected by COVID-19 you must not go to work for at least 10 days. During that time you must monitor any symptoms of COVID-19.

You must not go to work if you are especially vulnerable due to your age or because of prior medical conditions \(such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer or immunodeficiency\). You should seek medical assistance in order to obtain a certificate which will enable you to receive a temporary incapacity benefit.

### Case management

I. Children, parents/caregivers and facilitators should not attend the summer camp if:  

1. They show symptoms associated with COVID-193: fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms such as odynophagia \(painful swallowing\), anosmia \(impaired sense of smell\), ageusia \(impaired sense of taste\), muscle ache, diarrhea, chest pain or headache, among others, which can also be considered symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to medical criteria.  
2. They have been isolated due to COVID-19 diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection.  
3. They are in quarantine for having had contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms diagnosis. 

II. **Parents or legal guardians should alert the COVID-19 contact person at Kaleide Educación Activa directly and as soon as possible if someone in their household has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and should comply with prescribed measures of isolation and quarantine.**  

The COVID-19 contact person will gather information in relation to any contacts the family may have had and will get in touch with those belonging to Kaleide in order to coordinate the course of action to be taken.

III. If at any time a child shows symptoms associated with COVID-19:  

1. She/he will be taken to a separate space, and given a surgical mask to wear \(for 3 year olds and over\). A face shield should be available for the person taking care of her/him.  
2. The contact person for COVID-19 at Kaleide Educación Activa will contact the helpline on 900112061 and will coordinate the measures prescribed.  
3. If prescribed by the health professional evaluating the case \(900112061\), the child’s parents/caregivers will be contacted to arrange collection; if the healthcare professional evaluating the case \(900112061\) deems it necessary, the parents/caregivers will be asked to contact their pediatrician or family doctor. In case of severe symptoms or respiratory distress, we will call the emergency helpline on 112.  
4. All objects and materials used by the child in the 48 hours before isolation will be cleaned and disinfected.
5. If the case is confirmed, the Dirección General de Salud Pública, in coordination with the   Gerencia de la isla, will determine the measures to be implemented in relation to the rest of the children and facilitators at the camp who have been in close contact with the child.
6. Kaleide Educación Activa’s Contingency Plan will comprise an agile and permanent information system that allows the Dirección General de Salud Pública to identify close contacts of a person infected with COVID-19.
7. The contact person at Kaleide Educación Activa should be available even on weekends in order to provide the following if required:

* List of participants, with their contact information.   
* List of facilitators who have been in close contact with the child in recent days \(for example, updating any substitutes hired\), with their contact information.   
* List of students who have shared school transport with the child, with their contact details.

These lists must be updated to facilitate their immediate communication to the Public Health Services.  

IV. If the person showing COVID-19 symptoms is a facilitator, she should put on a surgical mask, go to an isolated area and contact the COVID-19 helpline on 900112061, where she will be given instructions on how to proceed, and she should also contact Previlabor \(our labour risk prevention services\) on 910 881 365.

**In case of severe symptoms or respiratory distress, dial 112.**  

V. Upon confirmation of a case affecting an employee of Kaleide Educación Activa, the Dirección General de Salud Pública, in collaboration with the island's Management and the labour risk prevention services, will contact Kaleide Educación Activa to carry out an investigation of the case, assess the risks, recommend precautions and determine the actions to be taken.  

VI. Measures to control absenteeism should be strengthened, especially among the most vulnerable population, with support staff and in coordination with health and social services. 

VII. Children who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 due to prior conditions \(cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, immunosuppression, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, etc.\), can attend the camp, provided that their clinical situation permits this and that they fulfill protection requirements rigorously. These special cases should be communicated to the health services.  In stable coexistence groups, social distancing measures will not be applicable within the group. However, social distancing will be required whenever the stable coexistence group encounters other groups of people or individuals.
